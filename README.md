The project centered around the creation of a chatbot "Mountain." 

Unlike traditional chatbots, Mountain was designed to mimic the user's responses, 
creating an echo effect and infusing humor into the conversation.

In the technical part, I used [RiveScript](https://www.rivescript.com/) first, and after about 10 Turns of the conversation, user's prompt will be sent to the API to talk to the LLM developed by Meta! (llama-2-70b-chat)



<hr>

## Error log on the API to LLM side

At the error part, sometimes got error messages with undefine stuff
in the end of the response 

[see the logs here](https://github.com/yclanlan/a2z-final/blob/main/error-log)
